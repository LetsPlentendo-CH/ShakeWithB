# ShakeWithB
A NSMBW mod which replaces shaking with pressing the B button

## How to run
This project was made with my NSMBW mod builder, [NewSouper](https://github.com/LetsPlentendo-CH/newsouper). To build the mod, install NewSouper with `npm install -g newsouper`. Then, in this directory, run `nsoup shakeWithB.json`. Copy the files in the export folder to your SD card and have fun!

Alternatively, you can also download the prebuilt files from the [releases](https://github.com/LetsPlentendo-CH/ShakeWithB/releases) and drag them to your SD card.

## Current issues
- Nunchuck is broken with this mod
